  <h3>CHRISTIAN CAREGIVING A WAY OF LIFE - KENNETH C. HAUGK</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>PREFACE</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Pain and suffering are a fact of life. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>physically, emotionally, relationally, or spiritually</li>
            <li>The <ins>distinctiveness</ins> of the care we can offer as Christians goes <ins>unidentified</ins> and <ins>unexpressed</ins>.</li>
          </ul>
        <li> CC-AWOL has a twofold purpose: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>to define, describe, and elevate <ins>distinctively Christian caring</ins>, and</li>
            <li>to explain how <ins>such caring</ins> can become <ins>a way of life</ins> for followers of Christ.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>The Christian <ins>perspective</ins> behind the book (a <ins>grassroots faith</ins>) </li>
        <li>Christian caregivers need to empowered and affirmed, but <ins>not at the expense of</ins> the valuable contributions of psychology and the other arts and sciences.</li>
      </ul>
  <li> CH 1 GOD AS THE CUREGIVER</li>
    <ul>
      <li>in hope every day like farmers</li>
      <li>Paul: "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.."(1 Corinthians 3:6-7)</li>
      <li>care (prepare the soil) -> cure (God)</li>
      <li>care: listening, empathizing, and helping people talk through their feelings.</li>
      <li>healing outcome: peace, calm, restoration, redemption, and salvation</li>
      <li>FREEDOM FOR THE CAREGIVER</li>
        <ul>
           <li>you are freed from false expectaions</li>
           <li>being fully present, communicating <ins>acceptance</ins> and <ins>love</ins>, and helping the one receiving care <ins>explore their thoughts and feelings</ins></li>
           <li>?God -> two pitfalls:</li>
              <ul>
                 <li>pressuring the other person to grow or change</li>
                 <li>responsible for the success</li>
              </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>FREEDOM FOR THE CARE RECEIVER</li>
        <ul>
          <li>w/o unrealistic expectations</li>
          <li>focus on love and care</li>
          <li>at a pace suited to the individual</li>
          <li>invest in the process by expressing feelings, sharing openly, being honest, and accepting care</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
